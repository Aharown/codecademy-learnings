SQL FUNDAMENTALS

WHAT IS SQL?

In order to build out features like storing, retrieving and modifying usernames, shipping addresses etc. in a website we need SQL, 
which stands for structured query language. 

SQL is a language that Data Analysts and Data Scientists use to query and analyze data.
SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of information organized into rows and columns. 
If you’ve worked with a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you might be familiar with working with tables. 
To get the information, you would write a query, or a program that would retrieve data from the table.

Here’s an example of a query that would select all of the columns —the * keyword is a shorthand for “all”— from the page_views table:

SELECT * FROM page_views;

Web developers and software engineers also use SQL to build apps that can save, modify, and access data. There’s even a growing field of data engineering, 
which is a specialized subset of software engineers who ensure that the applications they are working with accurately and efficiently record all of the required data.


OVERVIEW OF WEB DEV FUNDAMENTALS

We can build out websites and apps with the four following languages:

HTML — structures website content
CSS — applies styling to websites
JavaScript — adds interactivity to websites
SQL — allows your web application to store and retrieve data

While these languages are each essential to web development, many of them also have applications in other fields. 
For example, JavaScript was initially just a language for interacting with HTML, but JavaScript has expanded to be a general-purpose programming language that can be run outside of the browser. 
You can now build web applications, browser games, desktop applications, and even VR/AR experiences in JavaScript.
