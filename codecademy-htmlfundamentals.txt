HTML FUNDAMENTALS

WHAT IS WEB DEVELOPMENT?

- Having web development skills allows you to take your big ideas — whether it’s a simple website, 
a complex web application, or even a browser game — and build them on the web.

- The four main languages that we need to learn include:

HTML — structures website content
CSS — applies styling to websites
JavaScript — adds interactivity to websites
SQL — allows your web application to store and retrieve data


WHAT IS HTML?

- HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It provides structure to the content on a website, 
including text, images, buttons, videos, and more.

HTML is a practical place to start learning to code. You can build basic websites after learning just a little HTML, 
with text, images, and videos. You can always open up your work-in-progress website with your browser and see what you’re building.

HTML stands for hypertext markup language. In the next few exercises, 
we will look at the HTML acronym word-by-word to unpack what HTML really means.


HTML MARKUP

The ML in HTML stands for markup language. Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself. 
The same way that a teacher might “markup” a student essay by underlining topic sentences and circling spelling errors, HTML annotates the content within a web page.

A teacher might use a red pen to make sure that their comments are easy to distinguish from the student’s own work. HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags, 
which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less-than and greater-than signs).


HTML ELEMENTS 

HTML tags are the “markup” for HTML. They are annotations that provide information about the type of content they contain. 
Let’s take a close look at the syntax for how HTML tags surround content to create an HTML element.
The diagram displays an HTML paragraph element. As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of one opening tag (<p>), 
the content (“Hello World!” text), and a closing tag (</p>).

Let’s quickly review each part of the element pictured:

HTML element — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.
Opening Tag — the element name used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.
Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.
Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

<p>"Hello World!"</p>


COMMON HTML tags

Here are a few common tags that you can start getting familiar with:

<h1>This is a heading, it emphasizes text.</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph, it is the most common tag for larger chunks of text.</p>

<a>This is an anchor tag, used to specify the text that is the "anchor" for a link.</a>

<button>This is a button.</button>


HYPERTEXT AND THE WWW

The H and T in HTML stands for hypertext. Hypertext is text that is linked to other text. 
What’s so hyper about hypertext? The prefix hyper indicates that the text expands beyond the traditional constraints of the written word. 
Instead of reading documents from beginning to end, like you would read a book, someone going through hypertext can browse. 
By clicking on links from one document to another, the user can navigate to whatever page they find the most interesting and carve their own unique path through the web.

Many modern websites provide rich user experiences, with features like embedded videos, animations, and interactivity, 
so it doesn’t necessarily feel like you are just navigating from one HTML page to the next. But despite all of the advances that have taken place with the growth of the web, 
at its core the web is still just a collection of hyperlinked documents.


ADDING HYPERLINKS

An attribute in HTML provides additional information about an HTML element. It comes in a name and value pair with the structure name="value". 
For example, you can specify the width of an HTML element with the attribute width="500".

Links are created in HTML with something called the href attribute, which stands for hyperlink reference. 
The href attribute allows us to specify the URL, or address on the web, that a link should take users to. See below for an example of the href attribute in action.

When we set the href attribute on an anchor tag (abbreviated to <a>) we can specify both the text that should be rendered for the user (the text within the anchor tag)
and the URL that the browser should navigate to.

With this code, we’re assigning the value www.codecademy.com to the href attribute. When a user clicks on the text of this link (Learn to code!), they will be directed to www.codecademy.com.
